<p>Kanye West is an American rapper, songwriter, producer and even a fashion designer. This week, West announced on Twitter that he is running for US president in this year´s election.

West could still meet the deadline to run as an independent candidate in some states; however, some people speculate that West´s announcement is a publicity stunt.

The rapper just released his latest single, and his new album will be released soon. West made a similar announcement a few times before. During MTV´s 2015 Video Music Awards, he said that he would run for president in 2020, and last year, he said that he would run for president in 2024´s election.

It is unclear whether West has filed paperwork for his presidency with the Federal Election Commission. There seems to be no campaign committee set up for West for this year´s election.
