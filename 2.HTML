<p>This happens at a shopping centre. The shopping centre is in Poland. Two men are on an escalator.They are going down. Suddenly, somebody shouts, “Free burgers!” The men want the burgers. They must turn around. They must run up the escalator.They are going the wrong way. This is not easy for the men. They fall a few times.
People watch them. They film them, too. In the end, the men get to the top. People start to cheer.</p>
